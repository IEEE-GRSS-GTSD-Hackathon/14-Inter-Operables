Integrating Sanitation and Water Supply System for Sustainable Water Resource Development
Problem Statement
ROI: Chennai;
Access to clean water and sanitation facilities is still a major challenge, leading to a variety of health and environmental issues. To address this problem, there is a need to integrate water supply and sanitation systems to ensure sustainable development.
Solution
One approach to integrating sanitation and water supply systems is to use a weighted overlay analysis. This involves identifying different factors such as proximity to water sources,Water Treatment Plant(WTP),Sewage Treatment Plant(STP) and its connnecting services that affect the suitability of a particular location for water and sanitation infrastructure.

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be used to assign weights to these factors based on their relative importance. The weighted overlay analysis can then be used to create a suitability map, which highlights areas that are most suitable for the development of water supply and sanitation infrastructure.
Data Sources
•	Admin_Boundary: TNGIS (https://www.tngis.tn.gov.in/)
•	Surface water resources: HydroSheds(https://www.hydrosheds.org/)
•	Other All Infrastructure Data: OSM (https://www.openstreemap.org/)

Technology Used
Weighted overlay analysis using AHP is a powerful tool that can be implemented using Geographic Information System (GIS) software (QGIS). GIS technology allows for the creation of detailed maps that can be used to analyze spatial data and make informed decisions about the placement of water and sanitation infrastructure.
Conclusion

Integrating water supply and sanitation systems is essential for achieving sustainable development. By using a weighted overlay analysis with AHP, decision-makers can identify suitable locations for the development of infrastructure that will provide clean water and sanitation facilities to communities in need.
